    "description": "Kettering Health has begun notifying patients that their personal and medical information may have been compromised in a cyberattack that struck the regional hospital network last year. The healthcare system, which operates hospitals and medical facilities across the Dayton and Miami Valley region, confirmed that the breach stems from a ransomware attack discovered on May 20, 2025. The attack caused widespread technology outages across the network, disrupting patient services, electronic medical records, scheduling systems, and the MyChart patient portal for several days. In letters mailed to affected individuals in early February, Kettering Health said an unauthorized party may have accessed its network between April 9 and May 20, 2025, before the intrusion was contained. According to the notification, information potentially exposed varies by patient but may include names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license or passport numbers, financial account details, health insurance information, medical treatment records, billing data, and, in some cases, usernames and passwords. Kettering Health said it launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity experts and notified federal law enforcement. The organization reported that it has since taken steps to strengthen its network security, including reviewing and updating policies, procedures, and monitoring systems. The ransomware group known as “Interlock” previously claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it stole hundreds of gigabytes of data from the health system. Kettering Health has not publicly confirmed the exact volume of data involved but acknowledged that patient information was accessed. The breach adds to a growing number of cyberattacks targeting healthcare providers nationwide. Hospitals are frequent targets due to the sensitive nature of medical and personal data, as well as the operational urgency required to maintain patient care. Kettering Health is offering affected individuals complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. Patients have a limited window to enroll in those services following receipt of their notification letter. At least one lawsuit has been filed in connection with the breach, alleging the healthcare provider failed to adequately protect patient data. The litigation is ongoing. Patients who believe they may have been affected are encouraged to carefully review any correspondence from Kettering Health, monitor financial and insurance statements, consider placing fraud alerts or credit freezes with credit reporting agencies, and report suspicious activity immediately. Kettering Health operates more than a dozen medical centers and numerous outpatient facilities throughout southwest Ohio, serving hundreds of thousands of patients each year.",
