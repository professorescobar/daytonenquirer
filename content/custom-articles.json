    "description": "Kettering Health has begun notifying patients that their personal and medical information may have been compromised in a cyberattack that struck the regional hospital network last year. \n\n\n\nThe healthcare system, which operates hospitals and medical facilities across the Dayton and Miami Valley region, confirmed that the breach stems from a ransomware attack discovered on May 20, 2025. The attack caused widespread technology outages across the network, disrupting patient services, electronic medical records, scheduling systems, and the MyChart patient portal for several days. \n\nIn letters mailed to affected individuals in early February, Kettering Health said an unauthorized party may have accessed its network between April 9 and May 20, 2025, before the intrusion was contained. \n\nAccording to the notification, information potentially exposed varies by patient but may include names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license or passport numbers, financial account details, health insurance information, medical treatment records, billing data, and, in some cases, usernames and passwords. \n\nKettering Health said it launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity experts and notified federal law enforcement. The organization reported that it has since taken steps to strengthen its network security, including reviewing and updating policies, procedures, and monitoring systems. \n\nThe ransomware group known as “Interlock” previously claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it stole hundreds of gigabytes of data from the health system. Kettering Health has not publicly confirmed the exact volume of data involved but acknowledged that patient information was accessed. \n\nThe breach adds to a growing number of cyberattacks targeting healthcare providers nationwide. Hospitals are frequent targets due to the sensitive nature of medical and personal data, as well as the operational urgency required to maintain patient care. \n\nKettering Health is offering affected individuals complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. Patients have a limited window to enroll in those services following receipt of their notification letter. \n\nAt least one lawsuit has been filed in connection with the breach, alleging the healthcare provider failed to adequately protect patient data. The litigation is ongoing. \n\nPatients who believe they may have been affected are encouraged to carefully review any correspondence from Kettering Health, monitor financial and insurance statements, consider placing fraud alerts or credit freezes with credit reporting agencies, and report suspicious activity immediately. \n\nKettering Health operates more than a dozen medical centers and numerous outpatient facilities throughout southwest Ohio, serving hundreds of thousands of patients each year.",

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 Is Off to a Blazing Start: Here Are All the Big New Games on the Way",

    "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 has officially ushered in a new era for Nintendo, and if the release slate is any indication, the company is not slowing down. With a mix of brand-new first-party blockbusters, long-awaited sequels, upgraded editions of modern classics, and major third-party support, the Switch 2 is shaping up to have one of the strongest early libraries in Nintendo history.\n\nLaunching alongside the system, Mario Kart World set the tone for the console’s ambitions. Expanding beyond traditional circuits, the new entry introduces larger, more dynamic tracks and enhanced online features, positioning it as the definitive Mario Kart experience for this generation. Nintendo has long relied on Mario Kart to anchor new hardware, and with the added power of Switch 2, the series finally has room to evolve in meaningful ways.\n\nReports also point toward a brand-new 3D Mario adventure arriving in 2026. While Nintendo has not revealed full details, history suggests this could become the system’s defining title. From Super Mario 64 to Galaxy to Odyssey, each major 3D installment has redefined platforming for its era. Expectations are high that this next entry will serve as both a creative leap and a technical showcase.\n\nNintendo’s early first-party lineup is already impressively diverse. Mario Tennis Fever brings fast-paced sports action with modernized visuals. Kirby Air Riders revives the cult-favorite racing spin-off with upgraded performance. Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream marks the return of the chaotic Mii life simulation series fans have requested for years. Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave continues the tactical RPG franchise’s momentum with a new strategic epic. And after years of anticipation, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is finally landing with enhancements tailored for the new hardware.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise is the scale of third-party support. Switch 2 is not just receiving Nintendo exclusives; it is attracting major modern releases as well. Resident Evil Requiem and Resident Evil Village are both arriving in enhanced editions. Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition is coming to the platform. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and Street Fighter 6 are also confirmed. Sega is bringing Yakuza Kiwami 3, while Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered adds large-scale action to the lineup. Hades II continues its momentum on the system, and The Duskbloods, connected to FromSoftware’s parent company, is slated for release. Digimon Story: Time Stranger further strengthens the RPG offering.\n\nThe Pokémon franchise is also expanding on Switch 2 with Pokémon Pokopia, a life-simulation spin-off that takes the brand in a fresh direction. While a new mainline Pokémon RPG has not yet been detailed, expectations are high that Switch 2 will eventually host the series’ next major evolution.\n\nBeyond the headline titles, the lineup includes darker and more experimental experiences. Reanimal delivers a cinematic horror adventure. Opus: Prism Peak offers a narrative-driven journey. Kingdom’s Return: Time-Eating Fruit and the Ancient Monster introduces an ambitious action-RPG concept. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma arrives in a Switch 2 edition. Enhanced versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom take advantage of improved performance and visuals.\n\nLooking at the release window across 2025 and 2026, the cadence is aggressive. 2025 brought Mario Kart World, Kirby Air Riders, and Hades II. Early 2026 adds Mario Tennis Fever, Reanimal, and the new Resident Evil titles. Spring and summer introduce Pokémon Pokopia, Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, Kingdom’s Return, and Digimon Story. Late 2026 and beyond are expected to feature Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition, The Duskbloods, and the anticipated new 3D Mario.\n\nIf even a portion of these titles meet expectations, the Nintendo Switch 2 will not just be a successful successor; it could become one of Nintendo’s strongest platform launches ever. By anchoring the system with Mario Kart, preparing a new 3D Mario, delivering long-awaited sequels like Metroid Prime 4, securing substantial third-party AAA support, and maintaining Nintendo’s experimental charm with titles like Tomodachi Life and Pokémon spin-offs, the company appears ready to compete at full scale once again.\n\nFor longtime Nintendo fans and the broader gaming industry alike, this lineup signals ambition. And if this is only the beginning, the Switch 2 era may just be getting started.",
